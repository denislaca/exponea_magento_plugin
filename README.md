## Project structure

### Block

Block is taking care of passing backend data to frontend, everything from `Exponea.php` can be passed to frontend using defined functions.

### Controller

Controller classes are taking care of importing catalogs and orders to your project, in case of catalog you need to define the name of catalog you want to create.

### Helpers

`Helper.php` includes all the parsing functions and encapsulations for the right formating of the request. You can use these functions to write observers, there's a parser function for every object you can track.
